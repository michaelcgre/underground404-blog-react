      <h3>Underground 404</h3>
      <p>
        Underground hip-hop stands tall as a genre that defies conventions and
        amplifies unheard voices. These artists operate on the fringes of the
        mainstream. It is with great passion and purpose that I have created
        Underground 404, aiming to provide these underground hip-hop artists
        with the attention and recognition they deserve, while fostering a
        community that celebrates their artistic brilliance and unique
        perspectives.{" "}
